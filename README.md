# FFmpeg Dynamic Loading Wrapper Library

This library solves fundamental FFmpeg compatibility problems, providing developers with a stable and reliable media processing interface without versioning headaches.

## Library overview

A universal C++ wrapper library that enables dynamic loading and interaction with functions and data structures from various FFmpeg versions (starting from 3.2 to 8.0): `libavcodec`, `libavutil`, `libavdevice`, `libavformat`, `libswresample`, and `libswscale`. 
Allows client applications to work with any FFmpeg version without recompilation through a unified stable interface.
Built on Dependency Injection principles, it provides an abstraction layer over native FFmpeg APIs, solving binary compatibility issues between different FFmpeg libraries versions.

### FFmpeg compatibility challenge

Native FFmpeg integration faces fundamental compatibility issues:

1. **Binary Data Structure Incompatibility**

    FFmpeg data structures (AVCodecContext, AVFrame, etc.) are unstable between versions because of changes in field layout, sizes, and composition. Even with dynamic function loading, direct structure access causes crashes due to memory layout mismatches.

2. **Pixel Format Incompatibility**

    The pixel format system (AVPixelFormat) varies even within the same version, depends on different format codes for hardware accelerators (VDPAU, CUDA, VAAPI): dynamic numbering changes when built with specific hardware support. FFmpeg-loader solves that by using dynamic pixel format number binding (pixel formats deduced by names and saved to conversion table)

3. **Versioning Complexity**

    Each FFmpeg component has its own versioning system, major and minor versions for each libav* component. Fields in the data structures appearing and disappearing within the same major version


### Static linking limitations

Static linking of FFmpeg libraries approach creates new problems:

* **Binary Distribution Complexity**, particularly in Linux/macOS ecosystems where `libavdevice` tightly integrates with system libraries, and user cannot change installed version of FFmpeg binaries easily

* **Version Conflicts**: applications with embedded FFmpeg specific version cannot run everywhere

* **Hardware Acceleration specific build issues**. Statically linked FFmpeg with specific SDK support (NVIDIA, Intel Media SDK) often fails on other systems

* **No Fallback Mechanisms**. Your app just cannot start when FFmpeg statically linked libraries cannot be loaded


### Benefits of runtime dynamic linkage

* **Guaranteed Compatibility**. Applications work with any FFmpeg version from 3.2 (better functionality is comping from version 3.4)

* **Simplified Distribution**. Single binary works with all FFmpeg versions.

* **Automatic Fallback**. Runtime switching between versions, user code can provide path to FFmpeg libs that will be used

* **Future-Proof**. New FFmpeg version support added without client code changes


### FFmpeg-loader solution architecture

The library implements a multi-layer abstraction system:

* **Internal Versioned Namespaces**: Library downloads multiple FFmpeg versions headers and use correspond data structures related to binary versions obtained in runtime. Each FFmpeg version data structures set is encapsulated in separate C++ namespaces (`ffmpeg_3_2`, `ffmpeg_4_0`, `ffmpeg_7_1` etc.)

* **Dynamic Function Resolution**: all FFmpeg functions are loaded via `dlsym`/`GetProcAddress` at runtime

* **Unified Access Interface**:  developers work through a stable C++ API independent of FFmpeg version. Data structures can be obtained through single interface with getters and setters, but internally correct version of FFmpeg data structure version is used.

* **Automatic Version Detection for data interaction**: the library automatically detects loaded FFmpeg version and selects the appropriate implementation


### Key features

* **Zero Overhead Abstraction**. Minimal performance impact through template-based design

* **Exception Safety**. Guaranteed safety during loading errors

* **Cross-Platform**. Single codebase for all supported platforms

* **Extensible**. Easy addition of new FFmpeg version support


## Supported Platforms

Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, OpenWRT.


## How to build

`ffmpeg-loader` can be compiled as shared or as static library (default), which can be used inside your application.
Also it can load FFmpeg libraries dynamically, or statically (useful for **ios**).


Simple build (loader builds as static library, FFmpeg libraries are loaded in runtime)
```bash
cmake -B build
cd build
make -j
```

Set up loader for loader dynamic build. FFmpeg libraries used statically, user directories with FFmpeg are provided in command line:
```bash
cmake -DFFMPEGLOADER_LOAD_AVC_STATICALLY=ON -DFFMPEGLOADER_FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR="n:\ffmpeg\include\other" -DFFMPEGLOADER_FFMPEG_LIB_DIR="n:\ffmpeg\lib\win_x86_64" -B build
```

Build static library instead of shared:
```bash
cmake -DFFMPEGLOADER_BUILD_SHARED=OFF -B build
cd build
make -j
```

During `cmake` process, multiple versions of FFmpeg headers are downloaded and patched. All headers linked to single version as relatives includes.



## User C++ source code adaptation

For best understanding you may look into `examples` directory: provided example with regular usage of FFmpeg linking, and with loader library.

### How does it work

User calls FFmpeg functions via `IAvcModuleProvider` interface. It also provides data abstraction layer as `IAvcModuleDataWrapper` interface, provided by `module_provider->d()` call.

Data abstraction layer object is accessible after libraries successful loading procedure is finished.


### Common C++ code adaptation rules

1. Remove all includes libav* headers. Instead of them please add includes to FFmpeg loader files:
```cpp
// Remove that lines from your code!
#include <libavcodec/avcodec.h>
#include <libavformat/avformat.h>
...
```

```cpp
// Put these lines
#include <avc/ffmpeg-loader.h>
#include <avc/libav_detached_common.h>  // some useful constants from ffmpeg
```

2. Create loader instance and check AVC libraries loaded before usage
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<avc::IAvcModuleProvider> avc_loader = avc::CreateAvcModuleProvider3();
if (!avc_loader->IsAvCodecLoaded() || !avc_loader->IsAvFormatLoaded()) {
  // Dynamic libraries were not loaded - handle error
}
```

3. All direct calls to AVC libraries replace to calls through loader. And prefix FFmpeg data types with `avc::` namespace
```cpp
// replacement for avformat_network_init()
avc_loader->avformat_network_init();  

// replacement for AVFormatContext* fmt_ctx = nullptr
avc::AVFormatContext* fmt_ctx = nullptr;  

// replacement for avformat_alloc_output_context2(&fmt_ctx, nullptr, nullptr, filename)
avc_loader->avformat_alloc_output_context2(&fmt_ctx, nullptr, nullptr, filename);
```

  So, calls and pointers definition is simple. Just perform same call through object.

4. Data structures access adaptation. This is most complicated thing, you ndeed replace direct calls to structures fields with getters/setters via data abstraction layer interface calls

    Before:
```cpp
AVCodecContext* codec_ctx = avcodec_alloc_context3(codec);
codec_ctx->width = width;
codec_ctx->height = height;
codec_ctx->time_base = { 1, fps };
codec_ctx->framerate = { fps, 1 };
...
frame->format = codec_ctx->pix_fmt; // frame is AVFrame*, codec_ctx is AVCodecContext*

```

  After:
```cpp
avc::AVCodecContext* codec_ctx = avc_loader->avcodec_alloc_context3(codec);
avc_loader->d()->AVCodecContextSetWidth(codec_ctx, width);
avc_loader->d()->AVCodecContextSetHeight(codec_ctx, height);
avc_loader->d()->AVCodecContextSetTimeBase(codec_ctx, cmf::MediaTimeBase(1, fps));
avc_loader->d()->AVCodecContextSetFrameRate(codec_ctx, cmf::MediaTimeBase(fps, 1));
...
avc_loader->d()->AVFrameSetFormat(frame, avc_loader->d()->AVCodecContextGetPixFmt(codec_ctx));
```

  In some cases call produces input data structure modification:
```cpp
// this call modifies fmt_ctx->pb pointer
avio_open2(&fmt_ctx->pb, filename, AVIO_FLAG_WRITE, nullptr, nullptr);
```

  Solution: call getter, save pointer to local variable, provide pointer to variable into call, set modified value back:
```cpp
avc::AVIOContext* ioctx = avc_loader->d()->AVFormatContextGetPb(fmt_ctx);
avc_loader->avio_open2(&ioctx, filename, AVIO_FLAG_WRITE, nullptr, nullptr);
avc_loader->d()->AVFormatContextSetPb(fmt_ctx, ioctx);  // set modified AVIOContext to pb
```
